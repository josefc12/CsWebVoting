![Image of the nominating stage in cs_web_voting app](https://github.com/josefc12/cs_web_voting/blob/main/Images/cs_web_voting_Nominating.png)  

A web app for voting over Counter-Strike maps  
- or anything else that has a nominating stage and a voting stage in the span of ~3 minutes.  
Check license.  

Depends on:  
nodejs (```sudo apt install nodejs```)  
npm (```sudo apt install npm```)  
React (already taken care of by project dependencies)  
MySQL  
SignalR (aleary taken care of by project dependencies)  
dotnet 7.0.0 (download the script at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#scripted-install and then do ```./dotnet-install.sh --channel 7.0```)  
dotnet-ef tool (```dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef```)  

How to setup:  
Setup the database (needs MySQL):  
    Create the database:  
    ```sudo mysql```  
    ```CREATE DATABASE cs_web_voting;```  
    Look into 'appsettings.json' and customize the line at:  
    ```"DefaultConnection":"Server=localhost;Database=cs_web_voting;Uid=testuser;Pwd=12345;"```  
    If you installed MySQL exclusively for this project and have no mysql setup, you can create the testuser and the password by:  
        ```sudo mysql```  
        ```CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '12345';```  
        ```GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cs_web_voting.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';```  
    Do a migration (```install dotnet-ef tools 'dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef'```):  
        ```dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate```  
        ```dotnet ef database update```  
    After that's done, populate the maps table with map names. It's best to use the file maps.csv included in the Files directory. The app expects the maps to use a particular schema. ```DESCRIBE maps``` to check the generated maps table schema in mysql;  

Do ```dotnet build```  
Do ```dotnet run```  
Go to https://localhost:7292/  
Enjoy.  

How to:  
-> Input nickname, input room name  
    Others can join your room by inputting the same room name. If you input a room name of a non-existing room, a new room with such name will be created and will remain created until the session ends or when the last person leaves.  
-> During the first stage, wait for an admin to start the nominating process.  
-> During the nominating stage, each person gets to nominate 3 maps.  
-> During the voting stage, each person gets to vote on the nominated maps.  
-> At last, the map with the most votes is displayed.  

If you're running a dedicated server, you can run a script that would change the map or start a new server with the map.  

DISCLAIMER: I'm actually not sure how many concurrent session this app can handle.  

Customization:  
You can find the frontend in the ClientApp dir  
The style is original and can be found at ClientApp/src/tac-custom.css
